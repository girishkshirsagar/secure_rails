# Rails security best practices for developers

Everyone writing code must be responsible for security. :lock:

- Start with the [Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html) to see how Rails protects you.

- Identify various application specific config variables, secret tokens, passwords, credentials etc and store them in a location that exist as long as application is running, or keep them served using any service, with Rails 5.1 one can have encrypted secrets file, read more about this [here](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=rails+secrets+encrypted) and [here](https://medium.com/poka-techblog/the-best-way-to-store-secrets-in-your-app-is-not-to-store-secrets-in-your-app-308a6807d3ed)

- Even with ActiveRecord, SQL injection is still possible if misused

  ```ruby
  User.group(params[:column])
  ```

  is vulnerable to injection. [Learn about other methods](https://rails-sqli.org)

- Don’t use standard Ruby interpolation (`#{foo}`) to insert user inputted strings into ActiveRecord or raw SQL queries. Use the `?` character, named bind variables or the [ActiveRecord::Sanitization methods](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Sanitization/ClassMethods.html#method-i-sanitize_conditions) to sanitize user input used in DB queries

-  Don't pass user inputted strings to methods capable of evaluating code or running O.S. commands such as `eval`, `system`, `syscall`, `%x()`, `open`, `popen<n>`, `File.read`, `File.write`, `send`, `to_sym` and `exec`

- Sanitize the data/text/html/json that is getting rendered. [Be careful](https://product.reverb.com/2015/08/29/stay-safe-while-using-html_safe-in-rails/) with `html_safe`

- Use `json_escape` when passing variables to JavaScript, or better yet, a library like [Gon](https://github.com/gazay/gon)

  ```erb
  <script>
    var currentUser = <%= raw json_escape(current_user.to_json) %>;
  </script>
  ```

- Set `autocomplete="off"` for sensitive form fields, like credit card number

- Make sure sensitive request parameters are not logged

  ```ruby
  Rails.application.config.filter_parameters += [:credit_card_number, :password, :username, :login]
  ```

- Avoid rolling your own authentication unless you know exactly what you are doing. Consider using a gem such as [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), [Authlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) or [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance)

- Expire the session at log out and expire old sessions at every successful login, consider limiting the number of simultaneous sessions per account

- Log all successful and failed login attempts and password reset attempts (check out [Authtrail](https://github.com/ankane/authtrail) if you use Devise)

- Implement Captcha or Negative Captcha on publicly exposed forms

- Encrypt cookies even if an SSL connection is used. This way, an attacker will not be able to view or modify cookies even if they are intercepted, and the user will not be able to read and edit cookies in the browser

- Notify users of password changes, notify users of email address changes - send an email to both the old and new address. Set appropriate expiry date for reset password tokens.

- Rails protects you from CSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery) by adding an authenticity tokens on forms. You won't be able to submit to a POST action if you don't have the token. This is enforced by protect_from_forgery with: :exception that's added to application_controller.rb by default.
Do not skip this on your actions even for AJAX actions. When you use either rails-ujs or jquery_ujs, authenticity tokens will be added automatically.

- On some pages like the login page, you'll want to throttle your users to a few requests per minute. This prevents bots from trying thousands of passwords quickly. Rack Attack is a Rack middleware that provides throttling among other features.
```ruby
Rack::Attack.throttle('logins/email', :limit => 6, :period => 60.seconds) do |req|
  req.params['email'] if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
end
```

- The secret key base, database credentials, and other sensitive data should not be committed to your repository. By default, config/secrets.yml reads the secret key base from an environment variable in production. It is thus safe to commit secrets.yml to your repository.
If your database.yml contains your database credentials, it shouldn't be committed to your repository.
Rails 5.1 released a way to encrypt secrets. If you're using this feature you can commit the encrypted secrets file.

- Some apps provide an admin panel to superusers to manage data. Consider putting this on a different domain like admin.example.com. If the admin panel is separate from the main app, you can apply more restrictions like IP based filtering or require only connections through your VPN.

- On your server, create a non-root user and use that to run your application. In case the app is compromised, the attacker won't be able to do as much damage as when he has root access.

- Protect sensitive data at rest with a library like [attr_encrypted](https://github.com/attr-encrypted/attr_encrypted) and possibly [KMS Encrypted](https://github.com/ankane/kms_encrypted). Further if necessary, keep rotating the keys/hash/salts used for encryption, keep track of latest encryption algorithms and their implementation libraries 

- Don't install development/test-related gems such as [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) and [web-console](https://github.com/rails/web-console) in the production environment. Place them within a group `:development, :test do block` in the Gemfile. Prevents leakage of exceptions and even REPL access if using better_errors + web-console

- Avoid exposing numerical/sequential record IDs in URLs, form HTML source and APIs. Consider using slugs (A.K.A. friendly IDs, vanity URLs) to identify records instead of numerical IDs, as implemented by the [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) gem. Additional benefits include SEO and better-looking URLs

- When using slugs instead of numerical IDs for URLs, consider returning a `404 Not Found` status code instead of `403 Forbidden` for authorization errors. Prevents leakage of attribute values used to generate the slugs. For instance, visiting `www.myapp.com/users/john-doe` and getting a `403` return status indicates the application has a user named John Doe.*

- Ask search engines not to index pages with secret tokens in the URL

  ```html
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
  ```

- Ask the browser [not to cache pages](https://stackoverflow.com/a/748646) with sensitive information

  ```ruby
  response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
  response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
  response.headers["Expires"] = "Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT"
  ```

- Prevent [host header injection](http://carlos.bueno.org/2008/06/host-header-injection.html) - add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`

  ```ruby
  config.action_controller.default_url_options = {host: "www.yoursite.com"}
  config.action_controller.asset_host = "www.yoursite.com"
  ```

- Use [SecureHeaders](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders)

- Protect all data in transit with HTTPS - you can get free SSL certificates from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

  Add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`

  ```ruby
  config.force_ssl = true
  ```

- Add your domain to the [HSTS Preload List](https://hstspreload.org/)

  ```ruby
  config.ssl_options = {hsts: {subdomains: true, preload: true, expires: 1.year}}
  ```

- Rate limit login attempts with [Rack Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack)

- You might be a busy person. Security is not a very visible feature in most applications, and so sometimes it’s not a priority. Of course you know it’s important, but how can you fit it into your busy schedule? The answer may be in the power of habits, especially [mini habits](https://www.airpair.com/ruby-on-rails/posts/a-week-with-a-rails-security-strategy)



## Open Source Tools

- [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) is a great static analysis tool - it scans your code for vulnerabilities, [please check out what all common security issues are covered by brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/tree/master/docs/warning_types)
- [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) checks for vulnerable versions of gems

  ```sh
  gem install bundler-audit
  bundle audit check --update
  ```

  To fix `Insecure Source URI` issues with the `github` option, add to the top of your `Gemfile`:

  ```ruby
  git_source(:github) do |repo_name|
    repo_name = "#{repo_name}/#{repo_name}" unless repo_name.include?("/")
    "https://github.com/#{repo_name}.git"
  end
  ```

  And run `bundle install`.

- [nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) checks for vulnerable versions of JavaScript packages (if you use `package.json`)
- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) prevents you from committing sensitive info

  ```ruby
  brew install git-secrets
  git secrets --register-aws --global
  git secrets --install
  git secrets --scan
  ```
